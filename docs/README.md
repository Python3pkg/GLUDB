# GLUDB Documentation

This is the main documentation for GLUDB. The current plan is to deploy to
ReadTheDocs.io (aka RTD). Note that RTD will automatically use the mkdocs.yml
file and the contents of this directory.

You may also build/serve it locally using mkdocs. You can use the script
`make_docs.sh` to run mkdocs from an automatically built virtualenv in this
directory. It also has a command to run our `make_api_docs.py` script. To
build the documentation fresh:

````
user@GLUDB $ ./docs/make_docs.sh api
user@GLUDB $ ./docs/make_docs.sh build --clean
````

You can also serve the documents at port 4000 (as configured in mkdocs.yml):

````
user@GLUDB $ ./docs/make_docs.sh serve
````

And browsing to http://127.0.0.1:4000/

Please note that you must run `make_docs.sh` with the `api` parameter to
generate api.md. As a result, the auto-generate feature of the serve command
above won't update api.md to match new docstrings.
